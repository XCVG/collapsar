# Heroin Dusk
Version 1.0

Heroin Dusk is a basic dungeon crawl made using an old aesthetic. It began as a stupid joke I thought up when I was tired.

The game's world is set in the streets of a decripit city on the edge of ruin (Detroit). Gangs are using the safety of ineffective police to invade. You are a gangsta who takes up arms to find some more heroin.
