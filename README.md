# Dubnium - Ascension Adventure 2

Ascension Adventure 2 puts you back in the boots of The Adventurer on a brand new and massively improved adventure. It's a retro-styled, first-person dungeon crawl with elements of fantasy and sci-fi, now with a bigger and more detailed world to explore. The all-new battle system forces you to make choices, and you'll now face a greater variety of enemies with elemental strengths and weaknesses. New gameplay elements like elevators and changing floors switch things up, and a deeper storyline ties it all together.

Can you survive where others have broken and unlock the secrets of the Forge?

## Collapsar

Collapsar is the internal name for the "engine" that powers a few XCVG Systems games.


* Heroin Dusk
* Ascension: Adventure
* Ascension Adventure II

Collapsar is better defined as common chunks of code than an actual engine.
Collapsar is based on Heroine Dusk by Clint Ballanger http://clintbellanger.net

### Technology

Collapsar is written in Javascript using HTML5 canvas.

* Truecolor (Heroine Dusk's art is 16-color but the code doesn't care)
* 160x120 native resolution (this can be changed) [now 640x480?]
* Keyboard controls: WASD or Arrows for movement, Space or Enter for interaction
* Mouse controls: click to move or turn, or click buttons to interact.
* Touch controls: as mouse controls, supported on some modern device browsers.

### Compatibility

Collapsar should, in theory, work on any modern browser.

* Firefox 29 PC: Works.
* Chrome 35 PC: Works.
* IE9: Scales blurry and sound effects don't play.
* IE11: Scales blurry.
* Android ICS Browser: Extremely slow.
* Android JB Broswer: Extremely slow.
