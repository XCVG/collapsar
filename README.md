# Collapsar

Collapsar is the internal name for the "engine" that powers a few XCVG Systems games.


* Heroin Dusk
* Ascension: Adventure

Collapsar is better defined as common chunks of code than an actual engine.
Collapsar is based on Heroine Dusk by Clint Ballanger http://clintbellanger.net

## Technology

Collapsar is written in Javascript using HTML5 canvas.

* Truecolor (Heroine Dusk's art is 16-color but the code doesn't care)
* 160x120 native resolution (this can be changed)
* Keyboard controls: WASD or Arrows for movement, Space or Enter for interaction
* Mouse controls: click to move or turn, or click buttons to interact.
* Touch controls: as mouse controls, supported on some modern device browsers.

## Compatibility

Collapsar should, in theory, work on any modern browser.

* Firefox 29 PC: Works.
* Chrome 35 PC: Works.
* IE11: Scaling issues.
* Android ICS Browser: Extremely slow.
* Android JB Broswer: Extremely slow.
* Chrome Android: Works. Sizing issues on some devices.
