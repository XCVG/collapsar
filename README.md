# Ascension: Adventure

Out now! http://xcvgsystems.net/?page_id=144

Ascension: Adventure is a retro dungeon crawler and semi-sequel to Ascension.

Ascension: Adventure is based on the Collapsar engine which is based on Heroine Dusk by Clint Bellanger http://clintbellanger.net

## Story

It is five years after the people came down from the sky and changed everything you thought you knew. Some are already predicting that the Empire will collapse and kingdoms will fall. Some even say that magic will disappear.

You're an adventurer. You explore the unknown and you fight monsters. You're a good one, maybe even a great one. You've done some good and made a name for yourself.

Idarous, a town in Phellaes, needs your help. Something is grabbing people from the outlying villages at night. As soon as you hear it, you know there's more to it than monsters.

The day of the adventurer is coming to a close. But it's not over yet. You've got one last journey to make.

## Technology
